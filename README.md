I have made a simple single Linear Regression Model from scratch to understand how the gradient descent concept really works.
The key motivation of this was to understand the mathematical aspect and working of this model rather than just importing it from any pre-existing model.
Although i have imported MinMax Scaler for transforming the features.

Transforming the features were really important since I encountered errors when the dataset had really large values. 

Again the weight and bias obtained in normalized scale was converted back into the orignal scale and thus obtaining the plot which shows very low MSE meaning a good model was thus obtained.
